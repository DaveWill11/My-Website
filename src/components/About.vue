    <p class="main">Hey, I'm David, a new graduate in software/web development and IT services. Over the course
        of my education, I dipped my toes in several languages and frameworks with no real specialty yet.
        Most recently I used Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis and Docker to create a simple API for a friendly benchmark
        contest. I also have experience using Java, JavaScript, Swift, Xamarin, C#/.NET, React, Vue, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the IT services side, I have in-class and lab experience with Windows Server, Active Directory, System
        Center Configuration Manager, Linux, and Azure.
